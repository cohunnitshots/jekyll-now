# Who Am I?
Once upon a time there was a 17 year old black boy, he always took advantage of a great opportunity, his name is Corey ; i"m Corey.
My name is Corey O'Neal and I was born and raised in New Orleans Louisiana.
I always loved to learn new things because i believe that

knowledge is power , and who wants to be powerless?

I obtained the love of education from my mother , she graduated at the top of her while pregnant with me.
That inspired me to eliminate all the excuses and try my best to do anything i put my mind to.As a child my parents always motivated me to do what i want i wanted to do.
My mother name is Robin O'Neal and my father is Corey Jones. Although they were not together , they were both very active in my life.
Also, my grandparents , Donna Jones and Oscar Jones. They took care of me for as long as i can remember.
Sadly my grandpa died when i was 9 years old due to a heart attack. He was very sick prior to his death so i prepared myself for it.
He would always spoil me and give me toys when i would cry for them. But its many things about me that people don"t know.
Like when i was born i had a club foot. But the doctors quickly did a surgery on me and put a cast on my leg.
Although i cant remember the feeling , my mother and grandparents always tell me stories about it.
I played sports when i was young, the surgery didn't stop me from doing anything ; its almost like it never happened.
But now i"m not interested in sports , i love photography and film making. I focus on film making more because its a creative way to express myself.

# What Am I Doing Here?
I am 17 and i am in the 11th grade. Attend Franklin D Roosevelt's Collegiate Academy . They give us a great opportunity to get our college degree at El Centro college while we are still in High school. Many people don't get that opportunity so it was a blessing for me to be in the program.
When i heard about the program i came to Texas to live with my mother. I had never heard of anything like this anywhere, and i had to be apart of it.
So my 8th grade year i finished school in New Orleans Louisiana and came to Dallas Texas. When i came to Texas i was 15 years old. This was not my first time living in Dallas TX. When hurricane Katrina happened my family evacuated and went to Texas. Some went to Houston but me , my mom , and my little sister went to Dallas. We lived in Village Oaks with my grandmother for about 2 years. We finally moved out to live in Desoto for about 3 years . i moved back to New Orleans when i was 7 years old. Now i'm finally back in Texas for high school because the education system is better here. I see a huge difference in the schooling system in Texas , the education is more advanced.
